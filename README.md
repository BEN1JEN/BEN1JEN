### Hi there,
I'm Ben a 16 year old learning and programming for fun :)

- Iâ€™m currently working on [bit-link](https://gitlab.101100.ca), a social core sharing website.
- I post most of my projects [on a self hosted gitlab instance](https://gitlab.101100.ca).
- Hard tabs, 3 wide.
- I use arch btw (with i3).
